mole fraction == 0
remove rows with 'solvent' column water, methanol, ethanol, propan-1-ol
solute in IL and not IL as solute, this needs manual inspection of titles

## separate these two cleaning strategies for general purposes

if column V4 is empty move V3 to V4, V3 must be left blank
create a column for gamma, get the values from V4
create 3 new columns: temperature, pressure and mole_fraction
check the values in V1, V2 and V3, if the value is in the range <2 asign it to mole_fraction, if the value is in the range 
90-110 asign it to pressure and if the value is >200 asign it to temperature, otherwise no value will be assigned.
